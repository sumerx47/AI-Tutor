2334.00  : They see my disability, I see
5374.00  : my ability. They call me disabled.
7818.00  : I call myself differently abled. There
10782.00  : are some incidents that happen in
14830.00  : your life. Those incidents break you,
18394.00  : deform you, but they mold you
20126.00  : into the best version of you.
22254.00  : And the same thing happened to
24414.00  : me. I was 18 years old
26514.00  : when got married. My father wanted
28406.00  : me to get married, and all
29606.00  : I said was, if that makes
31286.00  : you happy, I'll say yes. And
33734.00  : of course, it was never a
36630.00  : happy marriage. Just about after two
38986.00  : years of getting married, I met
41482.00  : a car accident. Somehow my husband
44954.00  : fell asleep and the car fell
46918.00  : in the ditch. He managed to
48886.00  : jump out, saved himself. I'm happy
51094.00  : for him. But I stayed inside
53514.00  : the car and I sustained a
54862.00  : lot of injuries. The list is
56126.00  : a bit long. Don't get scared.
59386.00  : The wrist was fractured. Shoulder, bone
61646.00  : and collarbone were fractured. My whole
64034.00  : ribcage got fractured. And because of
66386.00  : the ribcage injury, lungs and liver
69534.00  : were badly injured. I couldn't breathe.
72690.00  : I lost urinal bowel control. That's
73838.00  : why I have to wear the
76034.00  : bag wherever I go. Three vertebra
78086.00  : of my backbone were completely crushed,
80486.00  : and I got paralyzed for the
82534.00  : rest of my life. I finally
84242.00  : ended up in a hospital where
85606.00  : I stayed for two and a
87906.00  : half months. I underwent multiple surgeries.
90646.00  : One day, doctor came to me
92026.00  : and he said, well, I heard
93114.00  : that you wanted to be an
94426.00  : artist, but you ended up being
95818.00  : a housewife. I have a bad
98358.00  : news for you. You won't be
100442.00  : able to paint again because your
101786.00  : wrist and your arm are so
103006.00  : deformed, you won't be able to
105022.00  : hold a pen again. Next day,
106414.00  : doctor came to me and said,
109054.00  : your spine injury is so bad,
111486.00  : you won't be able to walk
113854.00  : again because of your spine injury
115266.00  : and the fixation that you have
117438.00  : in your back, you won't be
118546.00  : able to give birth to a
122626.00  : child again. That day, I was
125810.00  : devastated. I asked my mother, Why
129014.00  : me? And that is where I
131186.00  : started to question my existence. Why
133814.00  : am I even alive? And that
135766.00  : is where I realized that the
136966.00  : words have the power to heal
139674.00  : the soul. My mother said to
143500.00  : me, this too shall pass. God
146746.00  : has a greater plan for you.
148346.00  : I don't know what it is,
151834.00  : but he surely has. And in
153770.00  : all that distress and grief, somehow
155262.00  : or the other, those words were
156874.00  : so magical that they kept me
158974.00  : going. One day, I asked my
160926.00  : brothers, I know I have a
162986.00  : deformed hand, but I'm tired of
164810.00  : looking at these white walls in
166298.00  : the hospital and wearing these white
168754.00  : scrubs. I'm getting tired of this.
169906.00  : I want to add more colors
171058.00  : to my life. I want to
173026.00  : do something. Bring me some colors.
174894.00  : Bring me some small canvas. I
177638.00  : want to paint. So the very
179640.00  : first painting I made was on
182946.00  : my deathbed, where I painted for
185094.00  : the very first time. It was
186502.00  : not just an art piece or
188774.00  : just my passion. It was my
191274.00  : therapy. And then I was discharged
193820.00  : and I went back home. And
195786.00  : I went back home and I
197334.00  : realized that I have developed a
198986.00  : lot of pressure ulcers on my
200166.00  : back and on my hip bone.
202000.00  : I was unable to sit. There
204314.00  : were a lot of infections in
205534.00  : my body, a lot of allergies.
207854.00  : So doctors wanted me to lie
209950.00  : down on the bed straight for
213154.00  : not six months, for not one
216706.00  : year, for two years I was
219522.00  : bedridden confined in that one room,
223518.00  : looking outside the window, listening to
225582.00  : the birds chirping and thinking maybe
226726.00  : there will be a time when
228454.00  : we'll be going out with the
231510.00  : family and enjoying the nature. That
234134.00  : was the time where I realized
237574.00  : how lucky people are. That is
240390.00  : the time where I realized that
242314.00  : the day I'm going to sit,
243594.00  : I'm going to share this pain
245082.00  : with everyone to make them realize
247434.00  : how blessed they are. And they
249762.00  : don't even consider them lucky. That
251818.00  : day I decided that I'm going
254014.00  : to fight my fears. We all
257226.00  : have fears. Fear of unknown, fear
260334.00  : of losing people, fear of losing
263566.00  : health, money. We want to excel
264798.00  : in career, we want to become
265826.00  : famous, we want to get money,
267554.00  : we are scared all the time.
270146.00  : So I wrote down one by
273074.00  : one all those fears and I
274194.00  : decided that I'm going to overcome
275618.00  : these fears one at a time.
277126.00  : Do you know what was my
280710.00  : biggest fear? Divorce. I was trying
282054.00  : to cling on to this person
284002.00  : who didn't want me anymore. But
286614.00  : I said, no, I have to
288358.00  : make it work. But the day
289834.00  : I decided that this is nothing
292790.00  : but my fear, I liberated myself
295706.00  : by setting him free. And I
298154.00  : made myself emotionally so strong that
299546.00  : the day I got the news
300694.00  : that he is getting married, I
302906.00  : sent him a text that I'm
304126.00  : so happy for you and I
305614.00  : wish you all the best. And
306938.00  : he knows that I pray for
309840.00  : him. Today number two was I
311406.00  : won't be able to be a
313934.00  : mother again. And that was quite
316946.00  : devastating for me. But then I
318514.00  : realized there are so many children
319906.00  : in the world, all they want
322674.00  : is acceptance. So there is no
324306.00  : point of crying, just go and
326566.00  : adopt one. And that's what I
330294.00  : did. People think that there will
331734.00  : not be accepted by other people
333734.00  : because we in the world of
336646.00  : perfect people are imperfect. So I
338182.00  : decided that instead of starting an
340266.00  : NGO for disability awareness, which I
342140.00  : know will not help anyone, I
344586.00  : started to appear more in public,
347114.00  : I started to paint. I decided
348374.00  : that I'm going to join the
350058.00  : national TV of Pakistan as anchor
351962.00  : person. And I've been doing a
354270.00  : lot of shows for last three
356394.00  : years. I became the National Goodwill
358602.00  : Ambassador for UN women. Pakistan. And
359838.00  : now I speak for the rights
362014.00  : of women children. We talk about
365086.00  : inclusion, diversity, gender equality, which is
367298.00  : a must. Every time I go
369086.00  : in public, I always smile. It's
370766.00  : always a big doody smile on
371794.00  : my face. And people ask me,
373554.00  : don't you get tired of smiling
375666.00  : all the time? What's the secret?
378020.00  : I always say one thing that
380454.00  : I have stopped worrying about the
381698.00  : things that I have lost. The
383270.00  : people that I have lost things
385346.00  : and people who were meant to
386774.00  : be with me are with me.
391946.00  : And sometimes somebody's absence make you
394234.00  : a better person. Cherish their absence.
397786.00  : It's always a blessing in disguise.
402906.00  : Live your life fully. Accept yourself
404734.00  : the way you are. Be kind
407934.00  : to yourself. Be kind to yourself.
409966.00  : I'll repeat, be kind to yourself.
411486.00  : And only then you can be
413998.00  : kind to others. Love yourself and
416814.00  : spread that love. Life will be
418474.00  : hard. There will be turmoil, there
420062.00  : will be trial. But that will
422654.00  : only make you stronger. So when
424126.00  : you accept yourself the way you
427190.00  : are, the world recognizes you. It
428660.00  : all starts from within.
